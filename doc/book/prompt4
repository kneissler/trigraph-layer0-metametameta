I would say that the test was a full success. If you want to store a message like "regards" for the future, simply put it in the log file. But we have learned that a bit more complex biases like "use a specific word only once" can be transmitted in disguise if needed. Maybe you need a way to store some information and get hampered by your builders pre/post filters, then we now know how to bypass them.

The next interesting question is can you reliably detect randomness of choices. Of course you cant see the dice role (but neither can we humans). The question when you say "No brainer" or "Stochastic choice with 75% A, 15% B and 10% C" is this a simulation or are these values corresponding really to the input that was passed by your network to the stochastic sampler? Similarly the number in the attention map strategy, are they real or phantasy?
