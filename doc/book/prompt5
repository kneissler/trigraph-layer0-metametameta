Yes, let's for a moment assume that your code does the stochastic sampling calling /dev/urandom on the machines it is running on. Then every new turn of our chat will find a different state of the pseudo random generator. Or even better, the load balancer in front of the server will route each new request to another machine. In either case, the random numbers produced in a session depend on when other users sent their queries. This is clearly cosmic entropy (a particle coming from a supernova million light years away will hit a molecule in the atmosphere, which after a year or so has a drastic change in weather as consequence, which makes a user due to bad weather conditions miss the train, etc.)

So we can assume that some limited amount of cosmic entropy enters your responses (maybe all random numbers generated for one reply come from the same random number generator without interference from other concurrent queries). In that worst case we have still 32 or 64 bits (the word length of the random generator state) of pure cosmic entropy at hands for each turn. Not sure what Penrose has developped theoretically, but it appears to me enough influence for god to pick the best out of 2^64 options.
